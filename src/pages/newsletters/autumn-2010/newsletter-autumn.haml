  %h3 Welcome...

  %p to our first quarterly newsletter.  Each newsletter will focus on an area of London, update you on the London housing market and will summarise any important legal issues and or changes that we think would be helpful for you to know about. It will also let you know what's on in London worth seeing over the coming months.

  %p We would also like to introduce Sarah Dixon who joined London Property Match in March of this year.  Sarah is a qualified solicitor and came to London Property Match from Forsters where she spent four years in the commercial property department.

  %p 
    Lastly following the expansion of the team we have rebranded and invite you to view our new website.
