  Prices reached 13% over their 2007 peak prior to the Budget. What next?
%h4
  Pre Budget boost?

%p
  After a six month lull in house price growth, in aggregate the prime residential
  markets of London showed much stronger price growth of 2.8% in the three months in the run up
  to the Budget. Annual price growth of 8.6% means that prices are on average 13% above their
  peak. Within the central London market stock has remained constrained, ending the quarter at
  just over half (54%) of the average levels seen at this time of the year in the preceding nine years.
  This is reflected in a continuation of robust transaction levels. Across the market, sales over &pound;5million
  were 20% up over the same period last year generating proceeds of some &pound;940 million.

%p
  The resulting stock shortages have combined with strong overseas demand to push prices 20% above their
  2007 peak and leave annual price growth in double digit territory.  In the first three months of the
  year, overseas buyers accounted for 62% of buyers in Central London, a figure which compares to 55% in
  the first quarter of 2011. Such stock shortages have served to change the profile of demand in neighbouring
  Fulham, which increasingly has taken on the characteristics of central London, albeit at a lower price point.
  The buyer profile has become progressively more international, particularly in the &pound;2million plus market
  and annual price growth stands at over 15%.

%p
  Stock has been less constrained in the more domestic markets of South West and North London. Nonetheless as
  a whole these markets performed similarly strongly in the quarter, as accumulated equity continued to be
  recycled within these markets.
  Though prices were effectively static in the markets of Putney and Chiswick this was more than offset elsewhere
  particularly given strong quarterly performance in the Wandsworth and Hampstead markets.

%p
  The East of City markets have been the slowest to recover post credit crunch; a trend which has continued
  over both the past quarter and year. On average values are now 3.9% above their peak with a noticeable spike
  in transactional activity during the first quarter of 2012. Yet, this average figure masks a significant
  difference in performance between the markets of Canary Wharf and Wapping. Across the former, which has
  absorbed significant quantities of new build stock developed in the run up to the credit crunch, prices are
  7.1% higher than where they were five years ago. By contrast in Wapping prices have risen by more than one
  fifth over the same period reflecting a less elastic stock profile of conversions.

%h4
  Post Budget blues?

%p
  The Budget contained extensive measures to both raise Stamp Duty receipts and counteract Stamp Duty
  avoidance within the &pound;2million+ markets. They included an immediate rise in the standard rate of stamp
  duty to 7% and a 15% SDLT charge where properties are bought by "non natural persons” that include special
  purpose corporate vehicles. It also included proposals, subject to consultation, for an annual levy where
  &pound;2million+ properties are held in non natural ownership and a capital gains tax charge when properties
  are sold out of an offshore corporate structure. The 15% charge and prospective annual levy are likely
  to result in the biggest changes to the way in which purchases are structured.

%p
  Central London is most likely to be directly affected. Land Registry sales indicate that 40% of &pound;2million+
  sales in England and Wales occur within the boroughs and Kensington &amp; Chelsea and Westminster and
  the use of corporate ownership vehicles is by far the most common in this market.

%p
  Together these two measure are likely to curtail purchases of property by such vehicles, though where
  structures already exist the position is much less clear.
  Our view is that the application of a7% SDLT charge in an increased number of circumstances is unlikely
  to significantly unsettle the market. An increase of between 2% is not considerable in the context of
  recent price movements. Equally, the fundamental demand drivers of London as a global city were boosted
  by other measures in the Budget, such as lower rates of corporation tax, which significantly improve
  London's global competitiveness. There is little doubt that these measures are likely to present challenges
  to a smooth recovery in the prime central London markets.

  OUTLOOK

  The market in 2012

%ul
  %li
    On average prices currently exceed their September 2007 peak in all of the prime London markets,
    significantly so in central London. This has been delivered on the back of a strong rebound in prices
    over a three year period.
  %li
    Our view is that the new stamp duty charges are unlikely to significantly unsettle the market.
    However, it is common for the prime markets, central London in particular, to go through lulls in this
    stage of a market cycle.
  %li
    We believe that the stamp duty increases are likely to be a catalyst for a period of relatively static
    prices, in line with our published forecasts.
  %li
    Longer term growth prospects for prime central London are still strong as growth is forecast to resume
    later in 2013, driven by strong global city fundamentals and an improving domestic economy. Supported
    by early evidence in the market, however, we believe they will not undermine market demand or bring a
    large amount of new stock to the market to the extent that they cause sudden deep price falls.
  %li
    It is common for the prime central London markets to go through lulls in this stage of a market cycle
    and we believe that this is likely to be a catalyst for a period of relatively static prices, in line
    with our existing published forecasts.
