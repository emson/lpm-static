%h2 Pimlico

%p
  Pimlico, bounded by Victoria Station, the River Thames and Vauxhall Bridge Road, is often a popular request among clients.  With fantastic transport links and proximity to Chelsea and the West End you can understand why.

    When people envisage Pimlico it is the white stucco terraces developed by Thomas Cubitt in 1825 that spring to mind. But there is a huge mixture of accommodation which means that the area offers something for everyone.  The largest and most opulent houses Cubitt built were along St George's Drive and Belgrave Road, the two principal streets, and Eccleston, Warwick and St George's Squares. Lupus Street contains similarly grand houses, as well as shops and, until the early twentieth century, a hospital for women and children. Smaller-scale properties, typically of three stories, line the side streets.

    Through the late nineteenth century, Pimlico saw the construction of several Peabody Estates, charitable housing projects designed to provide affordable, quality homes. Proximity to the Houses of Parliament made Pimlico a centre of political activity.  In the mid 1930s Pimlico saw a second wave of development with the construction of Dolphin Square, a self-contained "city" of 1,250 upmarket flats built on the site formerly occupied by Cubitt's building works. Completed in 1937, it quickly became popular with MPs and public servants.

    Local property prices reflect this eclectic mix of property; a studio  for sale in Pimlico starts from &pound;300,000 while a large house could cost up to &pound;10 million. Buyers who find the cost of Chelsea or Belgravia property too high often find the ideal, affordable house for sale in Pimlico, it being no less of a convenient location.

    The majority of our clients who are interested in Pimlico are first-time buyers and investors.  The squares, with their communal gardens or the “grid” including the “Moreton Triangle”  is where clients like to buy but the more modern blocks are certainly not to be dismissed.  These blocks offer more space for your money and are great buy-to-let investments. City workers and MPs favour the area due to the great transport links and therefore a good flat is always going to let well. Pimlico does has its fair share of council housing however which is something to be wary of when looking in the area.  The main throughfares of Belgrave Road and St Georges Drive are noisy and therefore best avoided unless the budget dictates.
