  %p Our New Year wish of more stock was sadly not granted.  Supply is down 50% on its 15 year average. The continued lack of supply has led to a significant price rise this quarter.  Prime central London values were up 2.8%, Kensington, Holland Park and Notting Hill are reporting price rises of 4.3%.  Most of our clients have had to offer the asking price and above over the last few months but the important fact is that we are still securing property for our clients and the need for our contacts and advice appears ever more important.

  %p In this issue we discover Battersea, Savills comment once more on the market, Forsters explain how to extend your short lease and we list the best of whatâ€™s on in London over the next few months.  

  %p 
    We wish you a very happy Easter.
