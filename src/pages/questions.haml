  %dd We currently operate in the Central, South and West areas of London.
  
%dl
  %dt What value range of properties will you search for?
  %dd From &pound;450,000 upwards

%dl
  %dt How much do you charge?
  %dd We ask for an initial retainer fee to begin our search of &pound;500 + VAT. The fee is then calculated at the higher of &pound;5,000 or 1% of the purchase price of the property plus VAT. This is payable on the exchange of contracts.

%dl
  %dt What does the retainer fee cover?
  %dd The retainer fee covers a four month search period. In the event that clients change the brief during a search, or a suitable property is not found by us, we will retain the initial fee and have the right to charge reasonable expenses.

%dl
  %dt Why should we not go straight to the Estate Agents?
  %dd Estate Agents work for and are paid by the seller, whereas we work exclusively for you the buyer.

%dl
  %dt How long do you take to find a property?
  %dd Each case is different but it can take anything from two weeks to four months.

%dl
  %dt When you have found me a property what happens next?
  %dd We negotiate the best possible deal and in this way we hope to save you our fee.

%dl
  %dt Do you help and advise the investor market, i.e. Those who wish to 'buy to let'?

%dl

%dl
  %dt Where do you get properties from?
