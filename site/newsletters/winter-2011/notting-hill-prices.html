              <h2>Property Prices in Notting Hill</h2>
              <p>
                Back in 1999 Notting Hill was a funky, bohemian place to live. Its residents loved the pubs, the carnival, the market, the village feel, and the general quirkyness of the place. A five storey town house in Artesian Road, just off Westbourne Grove, could be bought for well under &pound;1M. In fact, one of our clients bought one for just over &pound;750K.  Then Richard Curtis wrote the screenplay for a local movie with a few international superstars and the rest, as they say, is history.
              </p>
              <p>
                Notting Hill was no longer a secret gem among those locals 'in the know'. Suddenly Notting Hill made a lot of sense to a lot of people. Great transport links, great parks, great pubs, great restaurants, great diversity. Buyers flocked to the area and the number of property transactions went through the roof. Within two years our client in Artesian Rd saw his house double in price. There were bumps as we progressed through the naughties: September 11th 2001 caused a fair panic for 6 months resulting in price drops of up to 20% and only a handful of sales. Then, when people realized the world was not going to end, we started doing roaring business again. 2005 saw another bump, with the Iraq war causing uncertainty in the wider economy. Again the property market in W11 fell sharply for another 6 months before rebounding again.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cheap financing and city bonuses 2006 and 2007 saw an already booming market go into orbit. As residents realised their biggest asset was gaining as much as 10% per quarter, stock dried up and overwhelming demand pushed asking prices higher and higher. Summer 2007 is often referred to as the peak of this boom. What followed summer 2007 was dismal.
              </p>
              <p>
                Within 14 months prices had dipped by as much as 25%. A mass off-loading of investment portfolios and a fair amount of panic selling was met with minimal demand as buyers held their breath, waiting to see if the banking world would completely collapse like a packet of cheap playing cards. January 2009 saw an interesting phenomenon. Buyers were back with gusto. Historically low interest rates, coupled with prices 25% off their peak encouraged many savers to empty their bank accounts and invest in Notting Hill property to net a decent rental yield. These same low rates gave our European cousins a chance to get their own back on the English invasion of Provence, Tuscany and the Costas. Suddenly sterling was devalued and the Euro was strong. The combination of British savers and European investors was enough to kick start a recovery in Notting Hill property prices and by the end of 2010 we were trading at the same peaks of summer 2007.
              </p>
              <p>
                2011 has started with a bang. Each house we sell seems to be a record price for that particular street. City bonuses are good again this year. Financing and sterling are both still cheap too. The overriding factor, however, is that central London property is about as safe an investment as one can find in turbulent economic times. Add to this the most fashionable place to be in London and it explains why Notting Hill property price growth continues to outperform other areas of the capital.
              </p>
              <p>
                As for our client who bought in Artesian Rd for a tad over &pound;750K back in 1999? We just sold his house for a tad under &pound;3M. Not a bad return. Yes, there were bumps along the way but he never panicked. We told him to never panic. We told him when the market dips just hold on. It will come around again. He is retiring now and heading off for better climes. He thinks his house will be worth double that in ten years time. We agree.
