              <h2>Property Prices in Brook Green</h2>
              <p>
                Given Brook Green's proximity to Notting Hill, Holland Park and Kensington, property prices in Brook Green tend to track those of the Royal Borough where prices in prime parts tend to be 50% to 100% more expensive than those for comparable properties in Brook Green. The excellent state and private schools at all levels combined with very good public transport and a very strong cohesive community make Brook Green the number one choice for many of our Kensington and Chelsea neighbours.

                In the late Autumn/Winter of 2005 the jury was out as to the strength of the London housing market; Brook Green was no different. There were two schools of thought â€“ the positive and the negative. At that time the negative was the dominant faction and consequently it was with great surprise to most that prices increased and at a pace in 2006. In fact there was an effective quantum leap in prices somewhere between 10 & 20% across all market segments. At the end of 2006 the average prices in respect of flats and houses were approximately as follows:

                With the increasing ease of credit together with the choice of mortgage deals available, 2007 witnessed a further quantum leap in prices across all market segments.  Consequently the above prices increased by a further 10 to 20% depending on the usual variables and how special the property was in its category.  2007 was the first year when more than one house sold for in excess of&pound;1,000 per square foot.  The model 4/5 bed house in Sterndale, Dewhurst, Aynhoe road house was achieving +/-&pound;2M.
              </p>
              <p>
                With the advent of the global financial crises in late 2007, paralysis beset the market in 2008.  Prices dropped by between 10 & 30%.  However as much as 60% fewer units sold during this period.  Despite the pervading doom and gloom generated by the banking worlds' armageddon, we had no forced sellers during 2008.  Many of our vendors really wanted to sell, but ultimately they did not have to.  If sellers were trading up, it made great sense to do so and this category therefore fared very well.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was not until early 2009 that green shoots were observed.  With interest rates at an all time low and the fact that the global banking crisis had subsided, new business enquiries began to increase and the all important confidence began to return to the market.  Essentially prices traded at approximately 2006 levels across all market segments and strengthened as 2009 progressed.

              <p>
                2010 continued in strength as the pent up demand was satisfied in the first 6 months. House sales exceeded their 2007 levels in terms of units sold and average prices. For that special house i.e. above 2,500sq ft, prime location, good garden, off street parking, new records have been achieved. There is more demand than ever before for houses in the&pound;2.5M/&pound;3M plus category as the requirement for more space increases. The flats were trading almost at 2007 levels in terms of price with the special products doing even better. However the number of flat units sold continues to be reduced mainly due to the absence of first time buyers who are being limited by stricter lending requirements. Despite rising prices there are certainly opportunities for opportune buyers at the moment and I suspect for many months to come.
