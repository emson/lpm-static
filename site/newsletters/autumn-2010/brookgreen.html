              <h2>Brook Green</h2>
              <p>
                Brook Green is found behind Olympia exhibition hall and extends west to the Hammersmith and north to Shepherd's Bush.  It is a hidden oasis that despite its location manages to maintain a village feel. London Property Match's Sarah Dixon bought in Milson Road in 2004 and spent 5 very happy years there. What she most appreciated about the area was the outstanding access to transport.  With the District, Piccadilly, Hammersmith and City and Central line all within a short walking distance it is a commuter's paradise. The overland train is a further bonus. It departs from Olympia and takes you to Clapham Junction, Gatwick airport and beyond. If escaping London and heading West is your priority at the weekend, being minutes from the A4 and A40 could not be more convenient.
              </p>
              <p>
                Apart from the transport, Brook Green is ideally placed for shopping. If Westfield with its 14 screen cinema and 265 shops is too frightening a thought, stick to the local shops on Shepherds Bush Road, Blythe Road and Richmond Way. These roads host specialist delicatessens, dry cleaners, florists, gift shops, furniture shops, and chemists.  If it is a high street you crave head to King Street in Hammersmith or Kensington High Street.
              </p>
              <p>
                When it comes to dining out, Brook Green could not offer a more varied choice.  The Havelock Pub on Masbro Road is Sarah's preferred choice but one is not to forget the Thai food offered by the Old Parr's Head, the Indian curry houses on the Blythe and Shepherd's Bush Roads, the Lebanese food courtesy of Chez Marcelle and the renowned steaks in the Popseye Steak House.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lastly, for those with little ones, Brook Green is not short of a good school.  The private and state sector is represented by St Paul's Girls School, Bute House Preparatory School, Ecole Francais Jacques Prevert, Larmenier and Sacred Heart Catholic Primary and High School, Busy Bee Nursery and Addison Gardens Primary School.
              </p>
              <p>
                London Property Match has been a fan of Brook Green for many years and with many people becoming priced out of Notting Hill it is has now become very much discovered and sought after.  Roads that we favour lead from the Green and the Masbro and Blythe Roads.  Clients who have bought in this area have ranged from first time buyers to those seeking a family home.  If London Property Match had any criticism of Brook Green it would be that houses with large gardens are far and few between and one might say that Brook Green itself with its playground and three tennis courts does not provide enough compensation for this.  However with Kensington Gardens a short distance away this is a sacrifice many people are willing to make.
