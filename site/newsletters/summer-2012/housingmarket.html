              <h2>Market Update</h2>
              <h3>
                Prices reached 13% over their 2007 peak prior to the Budget. What next?
              </h3>
              <h4>
                Pre Budget boost?
              </h4>
              <p>
                After a six month lull in house price growth, in aggregate the prime residential
                markets of London showed much stronger price growth of 2.8% in the three months in the run up
                to the Budget. Annual price growth of 8.6% means that prices are on average 13% above their
                peak. Within the central London market stock has remained constrained, ending the quarter at
                just over half (54%) of the average levels seen at this time of the year in the preceding nine years.
                This is reflected in a continuation of robust transaction levels. Across the market, sales over &pound;5million
                were 20% up over the same period last year generating proceeds of some &pound;940 million.
              </p>
              <p>
                The resulting stock shortages have combined with strong overseas demand to push prices 20% above their
                2007 peak and leave annual price growth in double digit territory.  In the first three months of the
                year, overseas buyers accounted for 62% of buyers in Central London, a figure which compares to 55% in
                the first quarter of 2011. Such stock shortages have served to change the profile of demand in neighbouring
                Fulham, which increasingly has taken on the characteristics of central London, albeit at a lower price point.
                The buyer profile has become progressively more international, particularly in the &pound;2million plus market
                and annual price growth stands at over 15%.
              </p>
              <p>
                Stock has been less constrained in the more domestic markets of South West and North London. Nonetheless as
                a whole these markets performed similarly strongly in the quarter, as accumulated equity continued to be
                recycled within these markets.
                Though prices were effectively static in the markets of Putney and Chiswick this was more than offset elsewhere
                particularly given strong quarterly performance in the Wandsworth and Hampstead markets.
              </p>
              <p>
                The East of City markets have been the slowest to recover post credit crunch; a trend which has continued
                over both the past quarter and year. On average values are now 3.9% above their peak with a noticeable spike
                in transactional activity during the first quarter of 2012. Yet, this average figure masks a significant
                difference in performance between the markets of Canary Wharf and Wapping. Across the former, which has
                absorbed significant quantities of new build stock developed in the run up to the credit crunch, prices are
                7.1% higher than where they were five years ago. By contrast in Wapping prices have risen by more than one
                fifth over the same period reflecting a less elastic stock profile of conversions.
              </p>
              <h4>
                Post Budget blues?
              </h4>
              <p>
                The Budget contained extensive measures to both raise Stamp Duty receipts and counteract Stamp Duty
                avoidance within the &pound;2million+ markets. They included an immediate rise in the standard rate of stamp
                duty to 7% and a 15% SDLT charge where properties are bought by "non natural persons‚Äù that include special
                purpose corporate vehicles. It also included proposals, subject to consultation, for an annual levy where
                &pound;2million+ properties are held in non natural ownership and a capital gains tax charge when properties
                are sold out of an offshore corporate structure. The 15% charge and prospective annual levy are likely
                to result in the biggest changes to the way in which purchases are structured.
              </p>
              <p>
                Central London is most likely to be directly affected. Land Registry sales indicate that 40% of &pound;2million+
                sales in England and Wales occur within the boroughs and Kensington &amp; Chelsea and Westminster and
                the use of corporate ownership vehicles is by far the most common in this market.
              </p>
              <p>
                Together these two measure are likely to curtail purchases of property by such vehicles, though where
                structures already exist the position is much less clear.
                Our view is that the application of a7% SDLT charge in an increased number of circumstances is unlikely
                to significantly unsettle the market. An increase of between 2% is not considerable in the context of
                recent price movements. Equally, the fundamental demand drivers of London as a global city were boosted
                by other measures in the Budget, such as lower rates of corporation tax, which significantly improve
                London's global competitiveness. There is little doubt that these measures are likely to present challenges
                to a smooth recovery in the prime central London markets.
              </p>
              <h3>
                OUTLOOK
              </h3>
              <h4>
                The market in 2012
              </h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  On average prices currently exceed their September 2007 peak in all of the prime London markets,
                  significantly so in central London. This has been delivered on the back of a strong rebound in prices
                  over a three year period.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Our view is that the new stamp duty charges are unlikely to significantly unsettle the market.
                  However, it is common for the prime markets, central London in particular, to go through lulls in this
                  stage of a market cycle.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We believe that the stamp duty increases are likely to be a catalyst for a period of relatively static
                  prices, in line with our published forecasts.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Longer term growth prospects for prime central London are still strong as growth is forecast to resume
                  later in 2013, driven by strong global city fundamentals and an improving domestic economy. Supported
                  by early evidence in the market, however, we believe they will not undermine market demand or bring a
                  large amount of new stock to the market to the extent that they cause sudden deep price falls.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is common for the prime central London markets to go through lulls in this stage of a market cycle
                  and we believe that this is likely to be a catalyst for a period of relatively static prices, in line
                  with our existing published forecasts.
