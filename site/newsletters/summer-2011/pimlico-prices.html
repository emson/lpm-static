              <h2>Property Prices in Pimlico</h2>
              <p>
                For some time, Pimlico was rather seen as a no mans land. A small district, it was difficult to access and overshadowed by its more illustrious neighbours - Belgravia, Chelsea and Westminster.  I have to say that I also fell into this way of thinking. Living in Fulham it seemed miles away, and I always felt somewhat reluctant to make the trip in to see mates for a quiet drink after work.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, when I moved to our Pimlico office I wasn't entirely sure what to expect!  What I have learned over my two years here, is that Pimlico has much more to offer than initially meets the eye â€“ and it seems others are starting to realise this as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                Firstly it provides a diverse range of living, from family houses to small flats.  The 'Thomas Cubitt' buildings are the most popular with their Stucco fronts and period conversion flats.  There are new build developments providing all the comforts of modern living, as well as good ex-local authority flats that offer great value for money.  A first time buyer can still get on the property ladder in central London, with some one bedroom flats starting at around &pound;350,000 - show me that opportunity in Belgravia!
              </p>
              <p>
                Secondly, Pimlico has the facilities to suit almost everyone. Many people forget that Victoria is easily accessible from all parts of Pimlico.  For the working professional, Victoria station provides transport to the City, the West End and Canary Wharf.  For those looking for a pied-a-terre, you will find yourself in a perfectly central location, close to theatres and good restaurants; Sloane Square and the Kings Road are only a 10-15 minute walk away.  If you live abroad or travel regularly the Gatwick Express takes 35 minutes direct to the airport.
              </p>
              <p>
                For families, there are several good schools, the best known being Eaton Square and Westminster College.  Pimlico also provides three garden squares perfect for those with energetic children.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lastly, we have noticed that when people start looking for property in Central London they have found that comparably, prices in Pimlico stand out as particularly good value.  We are seeing an increasing number of people who have started their search in Chelsea and Belgravia coming over to Pimlico and realising that they can get the same type of property, often for up to 35% less.
              </p>
              <p>
                Taking all this into account, I believe that Pimlico is very much the place to be - and is rightfully coming out from the shadows of Chelsea and Belgravia.  When you are considering your options, don't forget this little enclave - it's rather good news.
              </p>
