    16:   This surge has continued almost unabated for the last 18 months, and we are now experiencing prices well above the historic high point of Spring and Summer 2007 before the Northern Rock collapse.<br/>17:   <br/>18: %p<br/>19:    It's accelerated this year too, with Rampton Baseley achieving record prices on any number of roads between the commons. We also think that this phenomenon is totally area specific. This isn't happening in Streatham or Tooting, or even other parts of Clapham. As far as we can tell it's only happening in gilt-edged, copper-bottomed areas of London; here, Putney, Barnes, Richmond, Wimbledon etc. It's certainly not happening in Gravesend and Solihull!<br/>20:   <br/>21: %p<br/>22:   We don't think that it's hugely prevalent over the river either â€“ it's not Indians, Chinese and Russian oligarchs and investment funds. It's normal middle class families wanting nice houses in nice parts of London with good local schools.<br/>
